# TentClient  - a C# client library for tent.io

TentClient is a library written in C# that provides a simple API for the tent.io protocol.

## Technical Bits

To get started, you must create an instance of the client by performing basic discovery

    TentClient client = await TentClient.Discover("tomasmcguinness.tent.is");

## Registering a new application

According to the tent.io documentation, all applications must first be registered before they can authenticate and be granted permission to a user's tent server. 

First, prepare a registration request.

    RegistrationRequest request = new RegistrationRequest()
    {
        Name = "My Super Duper Client",
        Description = "Most amazing tent.io client ever!",
        Icon = "http://example.com/icon.png",
        Uri = "http://example.com"
    };

Give a redirection url. If you're creating a web application, this will be your site. If you're creating a native application, you'll need to intercept calls to this URL later.

    request.AddRedirectUri("https://example.com/callback");

Ask for the permissions your application needs, giving the reasons.

    request.AddPermissionScope("read_posts", "Need to read posts so they can be displayed.");
    request.AddPermissionScope("write_posts", "Lets you share the cool stuff you do.");
    request.AddPermissionScope("read_followers", "Used to list all your followers");

Finally, send your request. If successful, this will return you an authorization url. 

    string authorizationRedirectUrl = await client.Register(request);

Open this URL in a browser, either by redirecting to it (if a web app) or by opening an embedded browser if it's a native application. This will request the user to authenticate and then authorize your app.

The Tent server will redirect back to your callback Url. Pass this Url into your TentClient instance to complete authorization.

	AppAuthenticationDetails authDetails = await client.ProcessRegisterCallback(calledUrl);
